### Web Sandbox

A tiny little tutorial app for those new to web development using Jquery


#### Getting Setup 

Clone or download the project. Jquery comes with the project so there is no need to download 
or fetch from a package manager like bower or npm.... we will cover those later :-)


Once the project is downloaded or cloned, simply visit the directory in your browser via a file path. No server needed. 

#### Example on Mac
```
file:///Users/<YourUserName>/<DirectoryYouDownloadedTo>
```


#### New to GIT? 

Watch some videos to get introduced to working with GIT and sites like GitHub & Bitbucket
